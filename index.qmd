# Implementation of Liquid Biopsies During Routine Clinical Care in Patients With Advanced Malignancies (LIQPLAT)


The LIQPLAT trial is a single-arm trial using routinely collected data and investigating the implementation and effects of routinely measuring circulating cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA) from liquid biopsies in patients with advanced solid cancer. We will evaluate the process of implementing ctDNA measurements in routine care, as well as patient relevant relevant outcomes such as quality of life and survival.
